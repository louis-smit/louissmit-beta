            Last week I rebuilt my personal website with Tailwind.css, a CSS
            framework that uses utility classes to compose interface styles.
            Having used it for a week on a handful of areas (like moving an
            entire website into a single page on my site), here are my first
            impressions. <a href="news.ycombinator.com">Some HackerNews Link</a>
          </p>
          <p>
            I&amp;m 99% sure I&amp;m doing something wrong, but whenever I
            update my root tailwind.css file, it takes forever to recompile my
            Next.js project. Sometimes 10-15 seconds (where a normal file change
            should hot reload my page in less than a second). I{"'"}ve tinkered
            with compilation settings, like avoiding CSS purging in development
            mode, but that broke production deploys. Clearly I{"'"}m doing
            something wrong, but the fact that it&amp;s not built in to the
            Tailwind ecosystem to optimize for local development feels wrong. I
            would love to see a stronger enforcement of great conventions built
            into the entire framework so that people don{"'"}t have to even
            bother reading docs for {"'"}how do I purge unused styles{"?'"} â€“
            this should be the default behavior, with intelligent changes based
            on the environment.
